# "GCE quota exceeded"  error in GKE clusters #

Running into a "GCE quota exceeded" error while scaling your GKE cluster indicates that your project has reached the quota limits for certain resources. Hereâ€™s how to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

## Example Steps to Resolve GCE Quota Exceeded Issue

**Identify the Specific Quota Exceeded:**

Run ```kubectl describe pod [POD_NAME]``` to identify the specific resource causing the issue. Look for the specific resource that has exceeded its quota, such as CPUs, GPUs, or specific machine types.

**Check Quotas in GCP Console:**

1- Go to the Quotas page and filter by region and resource

2- Filter the quotas by the specific region your cluster is in 

3- Check the usage and limits for the resources in question. If any quota set is lower than what the cluster is trying to scale to, then increase your quota.

**Now verify Resource Usage:**

Run ```kubectl get nodes -o wide``` to check current node utilization.

If running a Standard GKE cluster then you might want to optimize node pools if necessary. Consider adjusting your node pool configuration to use machine types that are within your current quota limits.
Example command to update a node pool:
```
gcloud container clusters resize [CLUSTER_NAME] --node-pool [NODE_POOL_NAME] --num-nodes [NUMBER_OF_NODES] --region [REGION]
```

Note: Enabling Cluster Autoscaling is one of the best practices when using GKE Standard clusters:
Use ```gcloud container clusters update``` to enable autoscaling for better resource management.


**Monitor Quota Usage is crucial in production envirnoments. As an implementaion engineer, managing mission-criticl workloads for your companies with GKE, it's recommended to set up monitoring alerts in the GCP Console to track quota usage and avoid future issues.**

1- Go to the Monitoring page in the GCP Console.

2- Create an alert policy that triggers when a specific quota reaches a certain threshold.

Regularly check your quota usage in the GCP Console to ensure you stay within limits and request increases proactively.
